![Batteries are not fuel image](FuelBattery.png)

bat-perf is a battery performance model appropriate for conceptual design and performance studies of aircraft.  It is a very simple approach, but it captures the required nuance for this purpose.

The ideas implemented in this model were first published by this author in a series of LinkedIn articles titled [Batteries Are Not Fuel](https://engrxiv.org/preprint/view/2803/version/4016) from 
September 7 to October 18, 2022.

Formalism underpinning these ideas was recently published by this author as an [AIAA Paper](https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/10.2514/6.2024-3903).
